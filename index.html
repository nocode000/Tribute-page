            <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1869</b> - Born in Gujarat.</li>
                <li><b>1883</b> - He moved to South Africa to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.</li>
                <li><b>1915</b> - He returned to India. He set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.</li>
                <li><b>1921</b> - Gandhi adopted the use of an Indian loincloth (short dhoti) and a shawl (in the winter) woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel (charkha) as a sign of identification with India's rural poor. </li>
                <li><b>1930</b> - Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942.</li>
                <li><b>1937</b> - The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D.</li>
                <li><b>1940</b> - Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.</li>
                <li><b>1947</b> - Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, the Hindu-majority India and the Muslim-majority Pakistan.</li>
                <li><b>1948</b> - Dies at the age of 78</li>
            </ul>
